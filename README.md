# Penny AI Front End Dev Test

## Instructions

Welcome to the Penny AI Front End Dev test. For this, we are asking you to build an Angular Component to act as a progress indicator.

This can take any form, a bar that fills up, or a wheel that spins around.. maybe a number that counts up or down. Use your imagination (or borrow someone else's) and build it in Angular!

The purpose of this is to test your Javascript, Angular, CSS and creativity; We have left this intentionally vague to allow you to demostrate to us how you would accomplish this in an authentic setting.

If you are new to Angular, read through the docs and put together something simple - we'll be looking at your ability to learn. If you're an Angular pro then this is your opportunity to impress us.

We'd like you generate a new component, and insert it into the box below. The <code>loading</code> property emulates the effect of a long network request / computation and should be used to control the display of your component, this is set to be between 4s and 8s.

## Installation

Run `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
# angular--progressbar
